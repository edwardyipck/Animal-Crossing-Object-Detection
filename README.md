# Animal-Crossing-Object-Detection

This project is to experiment on synthetic data used in object detection for Animal Crossing villagers. The synthetic data is generated by domain randomisation.
 - Inside the Greenscreen folder are examples of the villager heads extracted from taking screenshots in game by applying a CV2 greenscreen filter
 - Inside the Output folder are examples of the randomised images generated using domain randomisation
